# SatelliteConfig

A demonstration of how MetaEdit+ supports the Model Management Challenge 2025 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15285132). Each scenario from the MoM challenge is its own version in Git, with the MoM challenge starting point being version 1. 

The modeling solution presented enables collaborative simultaneous work directly in high-level models, minimizes the effort of modeling and integration, provides fast feedback on changes, keeps artefacts consistent, traceable and up-to-date, and provides hassle-free versioning. 

_For details about MetaEdit+ based solution for the Model Management challenge see the published [article](https://metacase.com/papers/MoM2025_Challenge-MetaEdit+-camera_ready.pdf)._

## Quick Start

**To see the how MetaEdit+ supports merge-free collaborative modeling with user-defined domain-specific modeling languages:**

1. Install MetaEdit+ from https://metacase.com/download/

2. Download the intial MetaEdit+ repository version, the binary file asset [SatelliteConfig1.zip](https://github.com/mccjpt/SatelliteConfig/releases/download/1/SatelliteConfig1.zip) from Release 1 here.

3. Unzip SatelliteConfig1.zip into your MetaEdit+ working directory (e.g. Documents\MetaEdit+ 5.5), to create:
   - SatelliteConfig directory with the MetaEdit+ repository
   - reports\src directory with the .owl, .json etc. files

4. Start MetaEdit+, select the new 'SatelliteConfig' repository and both its projects, and choose 'SatAlpha' as the Default project. Enter User Name and Password as 'config', 'antenna', 'solar' or 'thruster', and press Login.

For more details about satellite configuration scenarios, see the MoM challenge in https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15285132

The repository provided for MetaEdit+ can be used in both single-user and multi-user versions, the latter offering simultaneous collaborative modeling. The instructions given here are for single-user MetaEdit+; details about the multi-user version are outlined in https://metacase.com/mep/multi-user.html and detailed in the MetaEdit+ User's Guides.

## Extra: Full Git History

**Experienced users can link MetaEdit+ to GitHub and access the state of the repository after various versions.**<br/>See the [full instructions](https://github.com/mccjpt/SatelliteConfig/blob/77857d49171d2dc15fbdff7756671d24477b449c/README.md) in the earlier version of this README.
